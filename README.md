# Post installation script

This is my personal post installation script to setup my computer just the way I like. Feel free to steal some stuff.

Currently missing extensions:

* [Caffeine](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/517/caffeine/)

* [Media Player Indicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/media-player-indicator/)
